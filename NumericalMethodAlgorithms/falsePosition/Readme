The falsePosition function is a function that uses the false position root finding method to find the real roots of a function. This function must have an inputed function in the form of func = @(x) function.

Inputs:
func = Function that has roots.
xl = Lower bound guess determined by user. (Cannot be same sign as xu)
xu = Upper bound guess determined by user.
es = Desired relative error. (Defaults to 0.0001%)
maxiter = Maimum iterations. (Deafults to 200 iterations)

Outputs:
Root = The estimated root location.
fx = The function evaluated at the root location.
ea = The approximate relative error (%).
iter = Number of iterations performed.
